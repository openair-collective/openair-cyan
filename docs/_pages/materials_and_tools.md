## Tools Needed

Scissors (useful for cutting air tubing)
If you do not already have a scale for weighing, you will need one that has a precision to the nearest 0.1 g or less (0.01 g is preferable).
Tools for the optional Box and Fan setup
Drill with 8/32” drill bit (for fan mounting holes)
Box cutter (for scoring and cutting the fan ventilation holes)
Sharpie or other permanent marker (optional but very useful)
Small reciprocating saw (optional - would be useful for cutting the round ventilation holes on the sides of the file box)
Optional Materials for Testing
5% distilled white vinegar (for testing for CaCO3)
Spoon (for dispensing Ca(OH)2 without the need to pour it)
Assembly Time Required
Minimal unit assembly takes a few minutes, assuming you’ve already eaten the hummus from the hummus container. The file box + fan assembly can be done in 2 hours following the provided instructions.
